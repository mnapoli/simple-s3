Simple and dependency-free S3 client.

Inspired from [this gist by @marcoarment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1556315177624150021), this repository cleans up and makes the code available in Packagist.

## Why?

In some scenarios we want the simplest S3 client possible. For example in [Bref](https://bref.sh)'s runtime core we don't want to embed the full AWS SDK.

## Installation

```sh
composer require mnapoli/simple-s3
```

## Usage
